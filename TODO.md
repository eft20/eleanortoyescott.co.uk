- Change the colours. Cream background to light grey. Brown banner to navy blue.
- Divide screen into three vertical sections. Music content of current page all in left-hand column. Middle column - personal, blog, photos. Right column - work. 
- Reverse colours of middle column, i.e. navy blue background, light grey banner, navy blue lettering on light grey banner.
Not sure how to present blog and list of posts.
Space to display a few personal interest photos. (Not sure whether it's practical to have an archive, or whether just need to replace photos from time to time with more recent ones.)

Work section - Brief description of my work activities and background. Links to my Computer Lab page, my LinkedIn page, 4C website, 4C on LinkedIn, Canopy PACT website and Canopy PACT on LinkedIn.
